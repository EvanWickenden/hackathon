          <p>The 3157 Hackathon is an optional hackathon intended for students 
          and alumni of the <a href="http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~jae/3157">w3157</a> class. Throughout the night of October 25th, 
          from 9pm-5am, students will be working on two big assignments from the
          class. Alumni and TAs will be on hand to help students with these assignments.</p>

          <p>This hackathon isn't just a homework programming session, it's also an open 
          learning environment. Whether you're a hackathon veteran or this is your first 
          time, stop by. Representatives from <strong>Women in Computer Science (WICS)</strong>
          will be on hand to talk about their individual experiences in the field. If you're a Barnard
          student who would like to learn more about what its like to be a programmer, 
          or what a hackathon is like, do come by as well.</p>

          <p>Aside from all the awesome people, we'll also have <strong>pizza and drinks</strong>
          to keep you fueled all night, <strong>3157 swag, and swag from our sponsors!</strong></p>

            <li>
            <strong>Current students:</strong>
            work on <code>lab4</code> or <code>lab5</code>, 
            or help your classmates
            </li>
            <li>
            <strong>Former students:</strong>
            help out current students on <code>lab4</code> and
            <code>lab5</code> (while also hacking
            on your own projects!)
            </li>
            <li>
            <strong>Everyone:</strong>

          <h3>To be totally clear...</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Attendance is <strong>not</strong> required. It&apos;s
            completely optional. It&apos;s totally understandable if you
            have better things to do Friday night than geeking out all
            night</li>
            <li>If you come, you don&apos;t have to stay all night. You
            can come and go as you please</li>
            <li>At that time, both <code>lab4</code> and
            <code>lab5</code> will be open for submission. You can work
            on either.</li>
            <li>During the hackathon, we will have a very loose
            collaboration policy. You can look at your classmates&apos;
            code to learn or to help. You can sit down with someone else
            and try things together. All I ask is for you to make a
            genuine effort to learn or to help. You can list the poeple
            you have collaborated with in your README to make sure that
            your code does not trigger cheating detection.
            <ul>
              <li>Additionally, if you wish to set up a Github
              repo for yourself and your partner, the repo must
              be private. GitHub offers
              <strong><a href="http://www.github.com/edu">free</a> private
              repository to students, but it takes a few days</strong> to
              process, so make sure to sign up before the
              hackathon.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>The hackathon would also be a great opportunity for you
            to learn from your savvy TAs and classmates about some of
            the extra stuff that will enrich your shell
            experience&mdash;nifty <code>.bashrc</code> setups,
            <code>vim</code>/<code>emacs</code> setup, VirtualBox
            setups, using <code>GDB</code>, etc.</li>
            <li>For <code>lab4</code>, we are working on an option for a
            group of two to collaborate and do a little bit more. More
            info to come!</li>
